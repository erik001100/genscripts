General Scripts For My Laptop

makedailyfolders.sh
-------------------

This script requires the year to be changed in the script. You also need to
change the directories.

It will create directory for the year. 
It will create a directory for each month of the year. (01-12)
It will create a directory for each day in the month of the year.
(0-28,29,30,31)

The last day of the month is calculated using 'cal'.

This script could be better. I needed something quickly.

Command line arguments for directory and year would be useful.
